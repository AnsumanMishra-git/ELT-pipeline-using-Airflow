## Introduction  
In today's data-driven world, managing complex data workflows and orchestrating data processes has become a fundamental requirement for businesses of all sizes. As the volume and diversity of data continue to grow exponentially, organizations need a reliable and efficient tool to manage data pipelines, automate workflows, and schedule tasks seamlessly. One such tool that has gained tremendous popularity is Apache Airflow, an open-source platform designed to tackle the challenges of data orchestration and workflow automation.

## What is Apache Airflow?
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform created by Airbnb and later donated to the Apache Software Foundation. It provides a way to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor data workflows. Airflow's core strength lies in its ability to define complex workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), where tasks are represented as nodes, and dependencies between tasks as edges. These workflows are written in Python, making it easy for data engineers and analysts to express intricate data processing logic.
